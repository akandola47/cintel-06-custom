# cintel-06-custom

Objectives
This week, you take what we've done and plan and implement a custom project that includes interactive analytics and/or continuous intelligence. Can you take what you've done with Penguins and apply it to a different set of data? Can you take the Penguin dashboard and integrate aspects of live data and continuous intelligence? Where do you want to invest your time? What would you like to include in your GitHub portfolio? 

For Module 6, create a new GitHub repo named cintel-06-custom. Add your 4 recommended files as placeholders for your custom app this week.
